### what?
This was a take-home-exam for the "logic for cs" course i took in 2018-1. We have a robot that should carry documents between 3 offices. What were asked was to create a model so that the robot functions as specified, and then check with LTL specifications to be sure that our robot functions as intended.

### NuSMV?
Check [NuSMV](http://nusmv.fbk.eu/), it's cool.
